              <p>As a Product Engineer, my responsibilities involved taking ownership of the business goals of the problem area, to
                build a roadmap for exectution and execution.
              </p>
              <p>I owned First Party Procurement as a problem area. The core issue we were trying to solve was that of reconciliation.
                We were purchasing and selling a lot of inventory but all of the accounting was done outside the system.
                The larger goal was to systemize the procurement process so that every step could be documented, instrumented ands
                improved with insights. This would also help identify leaks and gaps in the financial process and prevent any potential
                for abuse.
              </p>
              <p>The architecture would include a Product Master, a Vendor Master, the layer to raise Purchase Orders for products to Vendors, the layer to match the goods received
                at the Warehouse against open POs and subsequently trigger the relevant financial workflow.
                I started a sole engineer on the problem which later expanded to 12 engineers working on various facets of the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Technical Overview</h5>
                <p>The project was written using Kotlin and Dropwizard. The frontend was built on ReactJS. 
                  All communication across services was done via RESTful Clients. We were hosted on Azure and leveraged a lot of azure 
                  products (AzureSQL, Cosmos DB, Cloud Storage)
