            <p>
              Hi, I am Saurav Kothari, a full stack engineer with 5 years of experience working with some of the fastest growing startups.
              I consider myself to be an engineer first, developer second; 
              i.e, my goal is to solve problems and technology is one of the tools I utilize to solve them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past years I have had the opportunity to work across a wide range of business domains from SaaS to e-commerce.
              I have worked across the stack over components that have been internal facing as well as user facing and I believe I can emphatize with
              the end consumer of my product. My experience as a Product Engineer has expanded my horizon to understand business goals and how to and how to 
              tie them to tech goals to create a win-win scenario for everyone involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been fortunate to have worked with various languages and frameworks and feel comfortable learning new ones 
              as needed and switching between them on the go.
            </p>

              <p>
                As a Product Engineer, my responsibilities involved taking ownership of the business goals of the problem area, to
                build a roadmap for execution and achieving business goals via tech and non-tech solutions.
              </p>
            </div>
            <ol>
              <li>First Party Procurement</li>
                <p>
                  We were building a product that would systemize the procurement process of goods at Udaan.
                  We were purchasing and selling a lot of inventory but all of the accounting was done outside the system.
                  The goal was to build first class workflows around purchases, inwarding and reconciliaton. 
                  This would help identify leaks and gaps in the financial process and prevent any potential
                  for abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The architecture would include a product master, location master, vendor master, the layer to raise purchase orders
                  for products to vendors, the layer to match the goods received at the Warehouse against open POs 
                  and subsequently trigger the relevant financial workflow(s).
                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Designed and developed a <strong>location master</strong> to maintain list of warehouses</li>
                <li>Each location was mapped to kind of goods being bought/sold at location</li>
                <li>Each location had an approval matrix that would allow for actions to be performed by specific individuals on the basis of access</li>
                <li>Designed and developed a <strong>product master</strong> to maintain a central list of unique products that can be purchased or sold</li>
                <li>Each product was a combination of identifying attributes of a product taking into account various packaging units</li>
                <li>Desiged and developed <strong>vendor master</strong> to store vendor information</li>
                <li>Each vendor was mapped to specific warehouses for which orders could be raised and delivered</li>
                <li>Each incoming shipment was matched to a vendor on the basis of tax information from the invoice</li>
                <li>Allow financial documents (po, credit notes) to be generated and sent directly to vendors via email</li>
                <li>Designed and developed a <strong>modular listing layer</strong> that can create sellable listings from product master</li>
                <li>The listing layer considered Udaan to be a marketplace and can be extended to allow for listing on any other platform</li>
                <li>All non identifying attributes of a listing (offers, price etc) could be managed independently</li>
                <li>Designed and developed a <strong>purchase order layer</strong> to allow for orders to vendors for warehouses</li>
                <li>Map purchase orders to vendor + location and only allow inwards of matching goods</li>
                <li>Every inward is checked against open POs for the vendor and only allowed if there is matching line item</li>
                <li>All deviations from the PO are recorded, staged in warehouse and require additional approval to be inwarded</li>
                <li>Allow real time action on deviations - allow excess or reject and return</li>
                <li>Every inward cycle to trigger the relevant <strong>financial workflows</strong> including vendor payments, adjustment notes, return notes etc</li>
                <li>Vendor invoices are digitized manually after each inward to capture correct purchase price</li>
                <li>Price changes for sales take into account the purchase price of goods and prevent accidental absurd price changes</li>
              </ul>
