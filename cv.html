              <p>The Cities team at Airbnb is an engineering team that builds systems to ensure Airbnb's compliance with government regulations. They aim to provide a seamless experience for guests, hosts, internal operations, and government regulators. The team also owns the City Portal, a product dedicated to serving the needs of government and building long-term partnerships with key Airbnb stakeholders.</p>
              <p>The Regulations & Automation team, which is a part of the larger Cities team, focuses on ensuring that Airbnb's services are launched in new geographical locations while adhering to local regulations. This process is made more efficient through automation. The team plays a crucial role in enabling launches at scale, providing tools to the Policy and Operational teams to do self-serve launches for a large number of jurisdictions.</p>

              <ul>
                  <li>Simplified the Automation backend at Airbnb to reduce the time to launch new bundles. This was done to address the slow and costly process of automating bundles due to high engineering costs. As a result, the backend effort for adding a new launch type was reduced by 80%.</li>
                  <li>Simplification was achieved by decoupling user inputs from backend operations by leveraging an abstract factory module for bundle-specific implementation. This module translates user inputs into task inputs, streamlining the process of launching new bundles.</li>
                  <li>Redesigned the review process for automated launch proposals to accommodate multiple reviewers, mandatory roles and persisted comments, managing automation bundles requiring up to 9 reviews</li>
                  <li>Partnered with the US team to expand automation capabilities to support more launch types</li>
                  <li>Co-designed support for editability to allow Ops teams to self-serve updates to regulations</li>
                  <li>Co-designed pre-launch analysis to compute the result of launches offline to enable safer updates</li>
                  <!--  -->
                  <li>Established and led a weekly automation standup to ensure project timeliness, updates, and resolution of engineers' obstacles.</li>

                  <li>Assisted in the integration of a new team members into the automation group, aiding in Netherlands and France subregion launches</li>
                  <li>Served as Primary POC for all automation support post transition to the Cities India team</li>

                As a Product Engineer, my responsibilities involved taking ownership of the business goals of the problem area, to
                build a roadmap for execution and achieving business goals via tech and non-tech solutions.

                <p>
                  We were building a product that would systemize the procurement process of goods at Udaan.
                  We were purchasing and selling a lot of inventory but all the accounting was done outside the system.
                  The goal was to build first class workflows around purchases, inwarding and reconciliation.
                  This would help identify leaks and gaps in the financial process and prevent any potential
                  for abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The architecture would include a product master, location master, vendor master, the layer to raise purchase orders
                  for products to vendors, the layer to match the goods received at the Warehouse against open POs
                  and subsequently trigger the relevant financial workflow(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was a massive overhaul of processes around warehousing, ordering, pricing and accounting.
                  Key stakeholders across each domain were consulted and agreement was reached to roll out pan-india in phases over 6 months.
                  The first warehouse was launched and the process stabilised in 1 month, 7 more were launched over the course of 2 months.
                  Pricing and Ordering workflows were rolled out 100% across two categories with the rest to be ramped up in quick succession.
                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Each location was mapped to kind of goods being bought/sold at location and had an approval matrix that would allow actions to be monitored and approved/rejected centrally</li>
                <li>Allow financial documents (po, credit notes) to be generated and sent directly to vendors via email</li>
                <li>Map purchase orders to vendor + location and only allow inwards of matching goods</li>
                <li>Every inward is checked against open POs for the vendor and only allowed if there is matching line item</li>
                <li>All deviations from the PO are recorded, staged in warehouse and require additional approval to be inwarded</li>
                <li>Every inward cycle to trigger the relevant <strong>financial workflows</strong> including vendor payments, adjustment notes, return notes etc</li>
